Steel - Ludum dare #23 entry by Lupinius

After crashing on a strange, small planet made out of steel the only thing in sight is a lever. Try to escape!

Development version, doesn't actually work right now. Give me some time, jeez.

Usage:
Windows: Just run the .exe file.
Other: Linux binaries might follow. In the mean time you need Ruby 1.9.3 and rbSFML installed to launch. To start the game use "ruby Steel.rb".
